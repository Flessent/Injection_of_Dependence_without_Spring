# Injection of Dependence without Spring Framework
This is basic idea behind the concept of Injection of Dependence
This is known as dynamic programming. That means instead of injecting dependences by using the 'new' keyword (static manner), we use a configuration file from which we load the classes to-be instantiated.
We can see that this is a lot of work. Thus some framework like spring have been built to adress this overwork.
This offers the advantage to build an application which is closed to modifications and opened to extensions. That means we can extend our application without needing to go through the old code.
